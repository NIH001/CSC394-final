        <p>The overall goal of this site was to promote more in person business because of how some restuarants and diners are still trying to recover from the pandemic. Alor of businesses have the option of ubereats and grubhub where you can order your food online and have it delivered directly to your door. With this comes many fees and services that the average person knows very little or none of but hurts the overall busniess depending on its status of work. Their are many small market family owned busniesses that can not keep up paying these fees and because of this are forced to either increse their prices or shut down completely.</p>
